# Contribution Guide

Contributions to the charts or the the docker images are welcome through PRs!

When making a PR, make sure:
- You describe what problem you are trying to solve and link to the issue it's solving if applicable.
- Describe what manual/automated tests have been applied to verify your PR.
- It would be great, if a helm test is added to test what your PR does. This makes it easier for the maintainers to verify your changes.
- Tag a maintainer as a reviewer in the PR to make sure they are notified about it.
